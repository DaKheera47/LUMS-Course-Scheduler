Welcome to the *Most Simplest Course Scheduler for LUMS students*

Background Story: When planning for Fall 2021, I was dumbfounded at the LACK of any real help that LUMS provides in choosing the courses and preventing any clashes. So as a passion project i began thinking about a solution.

This has then been updated for Fall 2021, Spring 2021, Fall 2022.

Future vision for this project:
  - Implement an ICS conversion system so that the calender can be synced to the cloud, and you can have easy class timing reminders.
  - Implement a course review system that allows for ratings, and feedback which can be esstential in helping students choose courses, and instructors.
  - Switch to NextJS
  - Update the UI/UX to be mobile friendly
Lo and Behold, THE MOST SIMPLEST COURSE SCHEDULER FOR LUMS STUDENTS!
